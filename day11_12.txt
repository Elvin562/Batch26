===  Create a package named "day_Date" under the folder "officeHours"  ===


    Task 1 :    Write a method that accepts a string and a non-negative number,
            	and prints a larger string that is number copies of the original String

                stringTimes("Hi", 2); = > HiHi
                stringTimes("Hi", 3); = > HiHiHi
                stringTimes("Hi", 1); = > Hi


	Task 2 :   Create a method that can print out the combination of two integer arrays
                int[] array1 = {1,2,3,4};
                int[] array2 = {5,6,7,8,9,10};

                Output:   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

    Task 3 :    Write a method that can remove  all extra space from String


    			 Input: "  Hello world      I      love      Java    "
        	     Output: Hello world I love Java

	Task 4 :   Write a method that can check if a number is Armstrong number

				Note: if I have a 3-digit number then each of the digits is raised to the power of three and added to obtain a number. If the number obtained equals the original number then, we call that armstrong number.


                print all the armstrong numbers with three digit
				Armstrong numbers are     === 153 370 371 407 === for 3 digits

				 153   ==  (1*1*1)+(5*5*5)+(3*3*3)
                             1       125      27  == 153
